# Editor
Text editor using WebGL and Rust/Wasm. Very much WIP.

## Next Up
- Getting input and inserting into the editor
- Deleting text (BTree ig)
- Cursor stuff, probably some more architectural changes in the process
- Make text less ugly
- Background color stuff
- Line numbers
- Select text
- Window sizing and whatnot
- Command system for editor mutations

## Mid-term
- Find, Find and replace
- Multiple canvases on the web
- Syntax highlighting; probably just make something super duper simple
- Graphics/shader stuff
- Persist data and whatnot

## Far in the Future
- Customization?
- Client-server architecture so that we can have nice things
- Cross platform stuffs
- Abstract away graphics stuff with cute macros and stuff
